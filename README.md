# Python Data Visualization

This project is a simple data visualization exercise using Python, pandas, and matplotlib.  
It reads student enrollment data from a CSV file (courses.csv) and plots a bar chart showing the number of students enrolled in different courses.

## Files

- P1_data_visualization_using_python.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook with Python code
- courses.csv — CSV file containing sample data of courses and student counts

## What you’ll learn

- How to read CSV files using pandas
- How to plot basic bar charts using matplotlib
- How to label and customize plots

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

## How to run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells to see the data visualization output.

## Sample Data

| Course           | Students |
|------------------|----------|
| Python           | 50       |
| Data Science     | 40       |
| AI               | 30       |
| Web Development  | 20       |
| Machine Learning | 25       |

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
Reading and processing CSV files with pandas.
Creating and customizing bar charts with matplotlib.
Uploading a Python project to GitHub with a clear README.
Documenting project outputs using screenshots.

### the future, this project could be expanded by:

Adding more advanced visualizations (pie charts, line plots, scatter plots).
Using interactive libraries like Plotly or Seaborn.
Processing larger and more complex datasets.
Building a small dashboard to interactively explore the data.
